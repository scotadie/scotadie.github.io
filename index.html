		<p>The subjects I take are:
		<ul>
			<li>Computer Science - </li>
			<li>Mathematics - </li>
			<li>Media Studies</li>
		</ul>
		<p> 
		I have coursework for two of the three subjects I take. While still doing
		the coursework for Computer Science, I recently finished my Coursework for
		Media Studies, which was a website. It was a Video Games Blog made using 
		Wix.com. I wish I could have coded it using HTML, but it would have taken
		me too long to get it to an acceptable standard.

		I enjoy Maths because it gets you involved in numbers, which is something
		I like to do. I enjoy Trig despite most of my friends despising it. I also
		enjoy differentiating and integrating.
